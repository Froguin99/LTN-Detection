# LTN-Detection
 Repository for all code relating to my PhD project looking to detect Low Traffic Neighbourhoods

Example scripts for each component of the processing can be found in the "Examples" folder. This is probably the best place to start. You will need to have Python installed, and access to the OS Open Roads dataset on your computer system. The script named "ltn_scoring" can be used to run all examples in one go, and this is the script used to produce the full LTN plausiblity scores.

This GitHub repo is very much a living document, hence it can be quite messy at times! If you have any questions or need anything explaining, please do get in touch!
